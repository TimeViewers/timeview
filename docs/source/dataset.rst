Dataset Manager
===============

The dataset manager window is available by selecting Window/Dataset Manager from the menu.
Datasets are a logical grouping of files.
The same file can belong to different datasets.

The top pane lists the available datasets.
The bottom pane lists the files associated with the selected dataset.
You can resize the column widths by dragging the edge of the column header cell.

To add a dataset, click the dataset "+" button and enter the (unique) name of the new dataset.
To remove a dataset, click the dataset "-" button; note that no actual files will be deleted.

To see which files belong to a dataset, select the desired dataset row, and the bottom pane will list the associated files.

To add one or more files, click the file "+" button; use modifier keys to add multiple files at once in the file chooser.
To delete one or more files, click one or more files (you can also use modifier keys), and then click the file "-" button.
