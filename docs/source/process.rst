Processors
==========

"Plug-in" :index:`processors` are external pieces of python code that are registered with the application.
As input they require one or more track objects, and possibly additional user-configurable parameters.
These inputs are set via a dialog-box.
Processing outputs will appear as one or more track objects using default rendering.

A user can initiate a process from the menu.

A new plug-in is very easy to write in either the python or the R language.
This allows for extensive customization, convenient development of new algorithms, and powerful leveraging of existing python libraries.
