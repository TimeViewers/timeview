Panels
======

A :index:`panel` shows a view area on the left, and a table of currently active views on the right.
The view table can be hidden by moving the splitter all the way to the right.
The view table can be shown again by moving the splitter left.

A user can *add* or *remove* a panel, and *increase* or *decrease* its vertical height, by selecting the appropriate menu entries.

Panels can be either time-synchronized, or all have individually selectable time regions. To turn synchronization on or off, select the "Synchronize" menu option.
When turning it on, all panels will match the time region of the last selected panel.

A user can also *re-order* a panel by dragging it by the whitespace just below the view table, moving it either above or below other panels.
