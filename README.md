TimeView


Overview

Timeview is a cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux) desktop application for viewing and editing
Waveforms, Time-Value data, and Segmentation data.
These data can easily be analyzed or manipulated using a library of built-in processors;
for example, a linear filter can operate on a waveform, or an activity detector can create a segmentation from a waveform.
Processors can be easily customized or created using the Python or R language.


Installation

Unzip the TimeView.zip file you have received at a location of your choice.
Navigate to the "bin" folder, and then to the folder that represents your Operating System.
Ensure your internet connection is live, and then run the "install" script.
Approximately 2GB of data will be downloaded during installation.
The entire process may take some time, depending on your computer and internet connection.


Starting the Application

After successful installation,
you can start the application by running the TimeView Application Launcher or Script that is in the same folder as the installation script.
(Note that the Application Launcher or scripts should not be moved from their original location; creating shortcuts or links to them should be fine.)
Advanced users can also run the application from the command line, with optional arguments controlling startup behavior;
for usage information, add the "-h" switch.


Help

After the application has started, select "Help" from the Menu, and then "TimeView Help" to learn more.
